First is the assertion that “most” NoSQL  databases do not use distributed file systems, the exception being HBASE which uses the HDFS file system. However, both of the NoSQL databases in the paper, Cassandra and MongoDB, use distributed file systems. MongoDB uses sharding which divides the data set and distributes it over multiple servers. The Cassandra database uses CFS, which is a distributed database very similar to HDFS and can also use HDFS. 
Either I’m missing something major or the author used some very out-of-date information (unlikely since the paper was published in 2013). I need to re-read this paper in detail before discarding it.},

The exact expressions of all measures of skewness, except for Song’s, are derived for the family of skew-normal distributions, while Song’s measure of shape is approximated by the use of delta method. The behavior of these measures, their similarities and differences, possible interpretations, and their practical use in testing for multivariate normal are studied by evaluating their power in the case of some specific members of the multivariate skew-normal family of distributions.},

By proposing that Information Systems researchers conduct applicability checks with practitioners on the research objects (for example, theories, models, frameworks, processes, technical artifacts, or other theoretically based IS artifacts) they either produce or use in theory-focused research, our paper presents an actionable, systematic approach to evaluating, establishing, and further improving research relevance. Furthermore, because it is an approach that can be conducted as an additional step either at the beginning or the end of the traditional research life cycle, it leaves untouched the rigorous methods used to conduct the study, that is, it does not compromise traditional research models. The approach we propose is based on the analyses of three dimensions of relevance that are critical to practitioners' attempts to internalize IS research findings (importance, accessi},

	url = {https://login.ctu.idm/oclc.org/?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1508812640?accountid=26967},
	abstract = {The move to cloud computing as mandated by the US federal CIO (Kundra, 2010) is one of the key initiatives expected to provide relief from US federal IT budget concerns. NIST was commissioned to provide guidance for the move. Federal agencies expressed concern that the guidance provided to them was deficient and GAO (2012) further stated that more planning was required. There is no research investigating the possible role systems thinking could play for complementing the NIST guidance and enhancing the planning. This study presents systems thinking as a complementary option to the NIST guidance. Using a mixed method, this study demonstrates first, quantitatively through content analysis that the NIST documentation does not take a systems thinking approach. Then secondly, this study qualitatively explores a systems thinking framework to supplement the NIST guidance. The framework is established based upon a thorough review of current scholarship in the areas of systems thinking and cloud computing using the established tools and methods of content analysis. The review of cloud computing demonstrates the diversity, complexity, and uncertainty of the technology. Systems thinking is shown to address just such situations. Based upon the research, a systems thinking framework is created that demonstrates how systems thinking could supplement the NIST guidance on moving to the cloud. Through the application of the framework US federal agencies could more confidently manage the risk of moving US federal assets to the cloud and thereby gain a firmer foothold in arresting the IT budget concerns.},

Research approaches that strive for relevance emphasize the particular at the expense of the general and approaches that strive for rigour emphasize the general over the particular. Inquiry that attains both rigour and relevance can be found in approaches to knowledge that involve a reasoned relationship between the particular and the general. Prominent among these are the works of Ikujiro Nonaka and John Dewey. Their epistemological foundations indicate the potential for a philosophy of science and a process of inquiry that crosses epistemological lines by synthesizing the particular and the general and by utilizing experience and theory, the implicit and the explicit, and induction and deduction. These epistemologies point to characteristics of a bridging scholarship that is problem-initiated and r},

IoT is primarily focused on those physical things that are network enabled and potentially able to interact on the network.  The paper lists five primary characteristics of IoT data: 1. Multi-source and Heterogeneity, 2. Huge scale, 3. Temporal-spatial correlation, 4. Interoperability, and 5. Multi-dimensional.  The paper sometimes seems to confuse Key-value and Column-oriented NoSQL databases. The solution implementation is Ontology based and uses XML for data exchange.
This could be useful as much for the included references as for the actual methodology.},

This is another paper that seems to want to narrow the definition of NoSQL databases to exclude Graph-bases and hybrid types of NoSQL databases. The authors talk about using SPARQL to query these NoSQL databases and even discuss RDF, while ignoring the existence of Graph-based NoSQL databases like Sesame and Neo4j which use RDF, support SPARQL, and were around well before this paper was written.
This paper is fairly well written, and will provide useful background on using ontologies for querying Big Data data. However, it is puzzling to me why the authors didn’t even mention the Graph-based NoSQL databases that were already being used when the paper was written.},

The study was constrained to the efficiency of key-value stores as implemented in SQL (MS SQL Express) and a variety of NoSQL databases.  The study seems poorly designed and I’m not sure what conclusions can really be drawn from the results. The dataset would necessarily have to be small since they used SQL Express, at least as compared to big data, did not take into account distributed or sparse data. It is also true that many, if not most, NoSQL databases are optimized for distributed operations, which were not tested by the authors. 
Although the study seems poorly designed and without supportable valid conclusions, it could be modified to use a larger distributed database set and at least two RDBMS systems that support distributed processing.},

There are three types of NoSQL databases: 1. Key-value stores like Amazon’s SimpleDB) 2. Column-oriented databases like Cassandra and Hbase, and Document-based stores. Most SQL databases do no support ACID since ACID support has a major impact on efficiency. Challenges: Overhead and complexity, reliability, consistency, new technology and limited ecostructure are some of the concerns and limitations. Most NoSQL databases are open-source. NoSQL adoption will be slow mostly because of the maturity and ubiquity of relational databases. Good article to get a broad overview of NoSQL.},

	doi = {10.1109/SAMI.2014.6822440},
	abstract = {One of the ongoing issues with NoSQL is the fluidity of the definition. This paper is an example of that issue. It compares RDF to NoSQL databases for Semantic Web applications. However, there are a number of Graph-based NoSQL databases like Neo4j, among others, that are either based on RDF/RDFS or support RDF. There are even a growing number hybrid NoSQL databases that support multiple “NoSQL” technologies.
The authors used Sesame, a native RDF database, OrientDB a multi-model graph-based and document-store database, and MongoDB a document store for the comparisons. 
I’ll use this paper for background information on the efficacy of using NoSQL solutions for semantic/sparse data that does not have a fixed schema.},

The article is focused on the Hadoop stack including HDFS and MapReduce.  The paper identifies three steps in deploying a BDA App: 1) implementing and testing the BDA app in a pseudo or small cloud, 2) deploying the application on a larger cloud with a larger data set, and 3) verifying the proper execution of the application.  The paper outlines a technique for step 3 that purports to be more effective than the normal verification techniques currently in use.  The paper is well written and makes sense. I’ll consider using this technique to verify my BDA App.},

There are excellent comparisons between the data currently handled by traditional systems and the new “Big Data” that has been causing traditional systems to falter.

	abstract = {Steganography is the art and science of hiding information. In the digital realm, steganography (which literally means "covered writing"), involves hiding data or messages in digital files and other digital structures. The carriers holding the hidden content may appear to be innocuous, and would be ignored by a casual observer. The field of digital information hiding has grown significantly since the 1990s. Evidence of this growth can be seen at workshops on information hiding and in occasional reports of use by criminals and terrorists as reported in the popular press. In contrast to cryptography where the message is encoded, the purpose of steganography is to hide the fact that a message is being sent. Once encoded, a cryptographically altered message typically appears unrecognizable and would raise suspicions. The primary advantage of steganography over cryptography is that the carriers do not attract attention to themselves, to messengers, or to recipients. Modern information tech},

	abstract = {The authors start from the premise that NoSQL databases were developed to answer specific needs an so they took a use case view of the capabilities provided by samples of the various kinds of NoSQL databases; Key Value Stores, Document Stores, Column Family Stores, and Graph Databases. They then used query possibilities, concurrency control, partitioning, and replication as the evaluation criteria. Each of these main categories was further subdivided into the type of support provided. 
Their conclusion was to “Use the right tool for the job”. Each of the NoSQL databases they examined was designed with specific use cases in mind. While you could force any of them into a particular use case, using the wrong technology could cause extreme variations in efficiency.

	note = {Much of today's data including social, biological, sensor, computer, and transportation network data is naturally modeled and represented by graphs. Typically, data describing these networks is observational, and thus noisy and incomplete. Therefore, methods for efficiently managing graph-structured data of this nature are needed, especially with the abundance and increasing sizes of such data.  In my dissertation, I develop declarative methods to perform cleaning, analysis and querying of graph-structured data efficiently. For declarative cleaning of graph-structured data, I identify a set of primitives to support the extraction and inference of the underlying true network from observational data, and describe a framework that enables a network analyst to easily implement and combine new extraction and cleaning techniques. The task specification language is based on Datalog with a set of extensions designed to enable different graph cleaning primitives. For declarative analysis, I introduce 'ego-centric pattern census queries', a new type of graph analysis query that supports searching for structural patterns in every node's neighborhood and reporting their counts for further analysis. I define an SQL-based declarative language to support this class of queries, and develop a series of efficient query evaluation algorithms for it. Finally, I present an approach for querying large uncertain graphs that supports reasoning about uncertainty of node attributes, uncertainty of edge existence, and a new type of uncertainty, called identity linkage uncertainty, where a group of nodes can potentially refer to the same real-world entity. I define a probabilistic graph model to capture all these types of uncertainties, and to resolve identity linkage merges. I propose 'context-aware path indexing' and 'join-candidate reduction' methods to efficiently enable subgraph matching queries over large uncertain graphs of this type.},

	url = {https://login.ctu.idm/oclc.org/?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1498473908?accountid=26967},
	abstract = {With the rapid development of smart devices and ever-increasing popularity of social media websites such as Flickr, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, we have witnessed a huge increase of multimedia data. Recently, social media technology and big data have converged to provide rich content on what happens around the world via texts, images, videos, audios, etc. Given the enormous volumes of multimedia data, efficient and effective retrieval of relevant information according to users' needs poses great challenges for traditional text-oriented storage and retrieval systems. Since manually annotating and managing the huge amount of information have become infeasible, data-driven approaches have received more and more attention. As a result, mining interesting patterns and human understandable semantic features automatically from raw multimedia data to facilitate large-scale knowledge discovery and information retrieval has become an essential research task in today's multimedia big data analysis.                 One of the central problems in multimedia big data analysis is automatic data annotation. The automatic annotation for human readable patterns such as the semantic concepts in video or image data sets provides the foundation for content-based search and retrieval. The biggest challenge that the researchers face now is the semantic gap problem, which is the gap between low-level features and high-level concepts. A lot of efforts have been made in bridging this gap in the multimedia research field. This dissertation mainly focuses on utilizing content information and inter-label correlations to improve annotation accuracy. The multimedia data annotation problem is first converted to a multi-label or a multi-class classification problem. Next, in order to model correlations among labels mathematically, we design an association affinity network (AAN) to capture such correlations.                 In multimedia data sets, the label correlation is usually hidden information. In addition, a large number of associations can be noisy. The scores from different models are also of different scales. Facing these challenges, we propose several steps in utilizing the AAN to address these issues. First, the output scores from different models are normalized using the Bayesian posterior probability approach. Second, the nodes and links are modeled properly under a given application scenario. Third, a link selection module is proposed to filter the noisy links using association rule mining and correlation mining. Next, the weights of different links are computed using different models, such as the collaboration model and the regression model. Finally, the newly computed scores are used for classification and/or data retrieval purposes. In addition, negative correlations, which have rarely been explored, are studied and utilized in this dissertation.                 The proposed framework is applied to two real-world applications: the multi-label high level semantic concept detection and the multi-class biomedical image temporal stage annotation. Experiments utilizing the benchmark data sets, such as the TRECVID semantic indexing data sets and the IICBU biomedical image data set, have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Generally speaking, the proposed framework achieves promising results. The contributions of different components are evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that modeling and utilizing the inter-label correlation properly could help improve multimedia data annotation accuracy and bridge the semantic gap. As the extensions of the existing framework, several future research directions are also proposed.},

A standard benchmark, Star Schema Benchmark (SSBM), a data warehousing benchmark, was used to measure the performance. The test attempted to emulate a Column-store in a Row-store database. The conclusion was that emulating a Column-store in a Row-store resulted in significant performance degradation in the Row-store database versus the Column-store database. This question is often asked in the context of adding functionality, primary support for SQL, to a Column-store by converting it to a tradtional relational DBMS.},

The authors chose two of the more popular NoSQL databases and did a performance-based comparison. Since MongoDB is a document store and Cassandra is a column store it was more of a comparison between two different types of NoSQL databases. The memory restrictions, 2GB of RAM, the use of a single measuring tool, failure to use the distributed features of the database, and other constraints make the comparison much less useful than it could have been. This is especially true since document-stores and column-stores are optimized for different use-cases.},

	abstract = {Teaching computer programming to freshmen students in Computer Sciences and other Information Technology areas has been identified as a complex activity. Different approaches have been studied looking for the best one that could help to improve this teaching process. A proposed approach was implemented which is based in the language immersion theory combined with extreme programming techniques and strategies associated with educational concepts, including collaborative learning, problem based learning, self-directed learning, and experiential learning. A study using the mixed method was worked. Combining qualitative and quantitative results through the triangulation approach, two groups were defined for an experiment that compared a group of students working with the traditional approach for teaching computer programming with another group using the proposed approach. The students' performance reflected on the posttest scores determined the main dependent variable evaluated from both groups. The groups constitute the independent variable. Throughout classes qualitative information was compiled using the Critical Incident Questionnaire for formative assessment. A questionnaire was administered to evaluate students' motivation toward programming, and another one to evaluate students' predisposition to continue in the program. In the experimental group the last activity was a focus group to evaluate the opinion of students regarding the proposed approach. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach was not significantly different from the traditional approach in terms of its efficiency. Furthermore, the data collected demonstrated that the proposed approach was not significantly better than the traditional one. Student's comments revealed they felt comfortable working with the proposed approach. This supports the results demonstrating it was efficient; however, this is not enough to establish that it is better than the traditional approach. Limitations were identified and considered instrumental in the results obtained. It is important to make adjustments to the design used and to replicate this study in diverse contexts in order to confirm the results obtained or to demonstrate what is still believed to be a valuable teaching approach.},

	abstract = {Background: As the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model is widely used for modeling and sharing a lot of online bioinformatics resources such as Uniprot (dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf) or Bio2RDF (bio2rdf.org), SPARQL - a W3C recommendation query for RDF databases - has become an important query language for querying the bioinformatics knowledge bases. Moreover, due to the diversity of users' requests for extracting information from the RDF data as well as the lack of users' knowledge about the exact value of each fact in the RDF databases, it is desirable to use the SPARQL query with regular expression patterns for querying the RDF data. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no work that efficiently supports regular expression processing in SPARQL over RDF databases. Most of the existing techniques for processing regular expressions are designed for querying a text corpus, or only for supporting the matching over the paths in an RDF graph. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for supporting regular expression processing in SPARQL query. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. 1) We propose an efficient framework for processing SPARQL queries with regular expression patterns in RDF databases. 2) We propose a cost model in order to adapt the proposed framework in the existing query optimizers. 3) We build a prototype for the proposed framework in C++ and conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our technique. Conclusions: Experiments with a full-blown RDF engine show that our framework outperforms the existing ones by up to two orders of magnitude in processing SPARQL queries with regular expression patterns.},

First, a format for a dissertation/thesis proposal is suggested and guidelines are offered for development of the proposal. The importance of a thorough review of the relevant research is stressed in a discussion on types of sources, which also considers use of computers for literature searches, word processing, and data analysis. Criteria for evaluating a research study are listed. The paper also provides suggestions for selecting the dissertation/thesis topic, selecting an advisor and committee, setting up a budget, surviving the oral defense, and writing a journal article based on the dissertation or thesis. A list of additional tips and suggested organizational strategies stresses the importance of beginning the thesis work early and utilizing faculty and other students for},

Initial impression is that it is a very bad paper whose authors’ did/do not really understand how to design a NoSQL instance or even the basic types of NoSQL databases.  There appears to be some confusion in the terminology also, they constantly refer to NoSQL tables??  Hiding the underlying storage model as the authors suggest, is, in my opinion a very bad choice in this use case. They would have been better off using an SQL database since they’ve chosen a use case with very structured complete data.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the intellectual property protection issues to achieve a better understanding of the posture of offshore outsourcing companies towards (a) IP due diligence and risk assessment in the pre-deal phase of offshore outsourcing contracts, (b) the role of offshore outsourcing companies' intellectual property (IP) and risk management principles and priorities in active offshore vendor selection, and (c) specific strategies for IP protection as part of contracts (either signed or in discussion) with offshore vendors. A quantitative survey was conducted to collect the attitude, perception, and opinions of professionals engaged or have been engaged in offshore outsourcing. In total, 307 participants contributed to the study. Data analysis revealed that, in general, United States companies involved in offshore outsourcing take necessary safeguards to protect the intellectual property. However, participants identified key areas of concern and made a number of recommendations for improving the security of intellectual property in offshore outsourcing.},

	url = {https://login.ctu.idm/oclc.org/?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305314056?accountid=26967},
	abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the perceptions of job satisfaction as defined by management and nonmanagement employees and to compare both parties' perceptions of organizational benefits to a list prepared by the organization's benefit personnel.


Turnover is costly to the organization, both in money and in the impact it has on those individuals remaining with the organization. Every effort should be undertaken to reduce the amount of turnover within the organization. A contributing factor leading to turnover may be a gap between what the employees believe is important to them and what management believes is important to the employees. The boundaries of the gap need to be identified before any effort can be made to reduce or bridge the gap. Once the boundaries are identified, policies can be analyzed and the possibility of reducing the gap investigated. Management as a whole must be aware of the needs and wants of their employees before any attempt to develop a retention strategy is undertaken. This knowledge can be acquired only through two-way communication with the employee. The communication process includes the simple process of asking employees for this information and then listening to how they respond.


This study suggests that little difference exists in perception of job satisfaction importance for gender, age group, length of time with the organization, topic training hours, and between management and nonmanagement employees. However, perception gaps exist between the job satisfaction items addressed by organizational policies and procedures and those perceived by employees. Additional studies that include a number of varied organizations are needed before extensive generalizations can be made.},

This is another paper that seems to want to narrow the definition of NoSQL databases to exclude Graph-bases and hybrid types of NoSQL databases. The authors talk about using SPARQL to query these NoSQL databases and even discuss RDF, while ignoring the existence of Graph-based NoSQL databases like Sesame and Neo4j which use RDF, support SPARQL, and were around well before this paper was written.
This paper is fairly well written, and will provide useful background on using ontologies for querying Big Data data. However, it is puzzling to me why the authors didn’t even mention the Graph-based NoSQL databases that were already being used when the paper was written.},

Residual performance risk, defined as the extent of difficulty in estimating performance outcomes during the later stages of the project, was modeled as a mediating variable. Based on a prior theory, six hypotheses were derived and empirically tested using a survey design. Data from 64 projects suggested support for the model, in general, and five of the six hypotheses, in particular. Increases in the standardization were directly associated with decreases in the residual performance risk which, in turn, led to increases in both process and product performance.},

	abstract = {Paper is focused on the viability of using NoSQL databases, MongoDB in this instance, for structured, modestly sized data stores. It is a well-designed study that highlights the differences between SQL and a single NoSQL type database, MongoDB. MongoDB is a BJSON based Document Store NoSQL database.
The study conclusion is that you should use what works best depending on your data set, there is no one size fits all solution. If you have a very structured small to medium data set a SQL database is probably a better fit. If you have a larger less structured data set MongoDB could be the better choice. 
Useful as one of a series of studies showing the performance differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
A good follow-up study would be repeating the test with distributed versions of the databases.},

The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type increasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino operations and were implemented at the MGM Resorts International's group of companies. The core of the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its relationship to targeted marketing effort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer behavior, and controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. As part of the framework, we also develop a new approach that accommodates the},

	abstract = {Paper is an overview of the good and the bad of the current and older crop of NoSQL databases. Limitation of SQL database for modeling Web 2.0 data.  Web 2.0 data is loosely structured and does not fit well with the relational model.  Limitation of having to learn SQL rather than a single imperative language. Large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data pushing NoSQL adoption.  Scaling to hundreds or even thousands of servers. Consistency constraints are less stringent for the new types of data.
States that “most” NoSQL systems don’t support high-level query languages with built-in optimization. Seems to make a clear distinction between XML (NoSQL) databases and NoSQL databases. Probably because XML databases pre-date the NoSQL craze. 
Good article with excellent references and makes good points. However, the author is a long time IBM employee and it seems obvious by what he has chose to highlight that he is a bit biased against NoSQL databases.},
